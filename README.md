## PowerShell Needed

Please make sure that you have PowerShell 5.1 (or above) installed on your device, so that the popups and prompts show up without any disruption.

On Windows devices, it should come pre-installed. However, on MacOS and Linux, you may need to download it at [this website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-5.1).

**Important Note: Make sure your computer is supported for PowerShell at [this website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-5.1).**

## Installation

To install, simply type the following command in your terminal/command prompt (making sure you have Node.js installed).

```
$ npm install popup-prompt
```

Then, when it is successfully installed, and the `node_modules` folder shows up, type the following in your JavaScript file.

```js
const popup = require("popup-prompt");
```

And that's it!

## Abilities

This amazing _npm_ module, `popup-prompt`, is very powerful! It can make popups so that you can show a better UI to your user!

The main capabilities that `popup-prompt` can do includes showing pre-made popups, and also making your own complex popups easily in just a few lines!

So, to use this extraordinary module, run `npm install popup-prompt` to use it now!

_Reminder: You also need PowerShell 5.1 (or above) installed on your device._

## Versions (Legacy and Coming)

To see the full history of changes, see the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

### Legacy Version

Version **1.1.5** included...

-   Added `componentListBox` method to the `Popup` class. This is used to allow the user to select an available option.
-   Added new `showCredentials` function. This asks the user for their username and password of any account (which you can specifiy). _Note: The username and password will be returned, so you will have to validate it._
-   Fixed a few minor bugs and code format.
-   Resolved the issue where icons and images would not show up correctly ([#5](https://github.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/issues/5)).

### Coming Version

_Note: The items below may change at any time._

Version **1.2.0** is set to include...

-   Added a new methods in the `Popup` class called `componentCalendar`. This displays a calendar for the user to select a date from.
-   Fixed a few bugs.

## Usage

There are currently three methods, two constants, and one class available. They will be shown below.

### Constant: `VERSION`

This constant simply shows the current version of the package.

**Warning: This may be out-of-date at times. Please make a [new Issue](https://github.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/issues) for this.**

To log it (with the `popup` variable) to the console, simple run the following code. It should show the current version as a string.

```js
console.log(popup.VERSION);
```

### Constant: `AVAILABLE_VALUES`

`AVAILABLE_VALUES` shows the available values for the methods, since PowerShell has limited values for specific parameters.
If you get stuck on what values are available, you can simply `console.log` it, and see an object with each method.

You may be a bit stuck on what `AVAILABLE_VALUES` prints out, so let's do it _now_!

In JavaScript:

```js
console.log(popup.AVAILABLE_VALUES);
```

Which then outputs...

```
{
    showMessageBox: {
        title: [],
        message: [],
        type: [ "OK", "OKCancel", "YesNo", "YesNoCancel" ],
        picture: [
            "Asterisk",    "Error",
            "Exclamation", "Hand",
            "Information", "None",
            "Question",    "Stop",
            "Warning"
        ],
        defaultOption: [ "Cancel", "No", "None", "OK", "Yes" ]
    },
    showPrompt: { title: [], message: [], defaultValue: [] },
	showCredentials: {
		title: [],
		message: [],
		username: [],
		targetName: [],
	},
}
```

_Note: This object does not show any methods of classes (e.g. `Popup`)._

Just a quick side note on this output: when the value of a parameter (e.g. `showPrompt.title`) is an empty array (`[]`), then it means that there are no default parameters; they can be anything!

### Method: `showMessageBox`

```
showMessageBox(title, message[, type][, picture][, defaultOption])
```

This method shows a customizable message box. It can have a title, message, button/buttons and an image.

_Note: When you run this method, you will notice a PowerShell file appear in your current working directory. This is essential for the popup to display. Also, when a user clicks on a button, a text file will appear with the button clicked. This is for the PowerShell file to communicate with NodeJS._

This method returns a `Promise`, which contains the button on which the user clicked on. The value can be either of the below.

-   OK
-   Cancel
-   Yes
-   No
-   None

Let's see a quick example of how to use it, and then, we will look at the functionality more deeply.

```js
popup
	.showMessageBox(
		"Confirm Deleting File",
		"Are you sure you want to delete the file? This action is irreversible.",
		"YesNoCancel",
		"Warning",
		"No"
	)
	.then((btn) => {
		console.log(btn);
	})
	.catch((err) => {
		console.log(err);
	});
```

So, when you run this code, you should see a PowerShell file appear in your working directory. Soon after that, a message should appear, similar to this one.

_Note: Depending on your OS platform and version, your popup may look slightly different. However, the functionality should be the same. Also, the window icon is the PowerShell logo._

![Show-Message-Box-Popup-One](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Show-Message-Box-Popup-One.png)

Then, logged to the console will be whatever the user chose (in this case, the choosen one is _No_).

```
No
```

Now, let's break it down.

The first parameter of `showMessageBox` is the title. The title is, as it may suggest, a string of the name of the popup/window. This appears when the user sees the top of the popup, and also when they see the taskbar (Windows) and see the name.

The second parameter is the description, where you can write a sentence or two, telling the user what the popup is for.

After that, the optional parameters come in. The third parameter are the buttons that display on the bottom. They, however, can only be of the following values. Passing anything other than this will cause an error.

-   OK
-   OKCancel
-   YesNo\*
-   YesNoCancel

_\* When this value is set, the **X** (close) button is disabled._

The fourth optional parameter is the icon to display. This is a set list of icons, and must only be of the following values.

-   Asterisk
-   Error
-   Exclamation
-   Hand
-   Information
-   None\*
-   Question
-   Stop
-   Warning

_\* When `None` is set, there is no icon._

The last parameter is optional, and it is the default value for the button. So, if the user clicks _Enter_ when the popup comes, and the default value is set, then it will automatically go with it. It must be one of the following.

-   OK
-   Cancel
-   Yes
-   No
-   None

And that's it! This method can be very helpful for displaying information, warning, and error messages to your users, instead of just logging it to the console!

### Method: `showPrompt`

```
showPrompt(title, message[, defaultValue])
```

The method creates a customizable prompt popup. This includes the title, the message, and the default value for the text field.

_Note: When you run this method, you will notice a PowerShell file appear in your current working directory. This is essential for the prompt to display. Also, when the user enters their text, a text file will appear with the text entered. This is for the PowerShell file to communicate with NodeJS._

This method returns a `Promise`, which contains the string that the user entered. _Note: If the user presses the Cancel button, or presses the **X** (close) button, then the returned value will be a zero-length string._

Below is an example of how to use the method.

```js
popup
	.showPrompt("New File", "Type the new file name below.", "text.txt")
	.then((fileName) => {
		console.log(fileName);
	})
	.catch((err) => {
		console.log(err);
	});
```

When you run the code, like `showMessageBox`, a PowerShell file will appear in your current working directory, and then, a prompt message similar to this one (depending on your OS, the prompt may look different) will show up.

![Show-Prompt-Popup-Two](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Show-Prompt-Popup-Two.png)

Once the user clicks _Enter_, the _OK_ button, the _Cancel_ button, or the _Close_ button, a text file will appear in your current working directory, and then, in the terminal/command prompt, the text that the user entered will show up. In this example, we will pretend that the user entered _text.txt_.

```
text.txt
```

Now, let's go over what happens.

The first parameter, like `showMessageBox`, is the title. This is a string that should appear at the top on the popup window, and also on the taskbar (Windows) when they hover over the window.

After that, the second parameter is the message. This can be a sentence or two, telling the user what the prompt is for.

Finally, the last parameter is optional, and that is the default value. This is the value that should appear by default in the text field. This will be highlighted (like in the picture), so that if the user wants to go with it, they can just press _Enter_.

You may notice that unlike `showMessageBox`, not one of `showPrompt`'s parameters has some set values.

And that's how easy it is to display a prompt to your user to get some data from them!

### Method: `showCredentials`

```
showCredentials(title, message[, username][, targetName])
```

The method creates a credential popup, which asks the user for their credentials. This includes the title, the message, and a default username and/or target name.

_Note: When you run this method, you will notice a PowerShell file appear in your current working directory. This is essential for the credential to display. Also, when the user enters their text, a text file will appear with the text entered. This is for the PowerShell file to communicate with NodeJS._

This method returns a `Promise`, which contains an object with credential and error information. _Note: If the user presses the Cancel button, presses the **X** (close) button, or an error occured, then the returned value will have `username` and `password` be `null`._

Below is an example of how to use the method.

```js
popup
	.showCredentials(
		"Popup Prompt Login",
		"Please enter your credentials to login to Popup Prompt.",
		"",
		"popup-prompt"
	)
	.then((cred) => {
		console.log(cred);
	})
	.catch((err) => {
		console.log(err);
	});
```

When you run the code, a PowerShell file will appear in your current working directory, and then, a credential popup, similar to the one below (depending on your OS) will show up.

![Show-Credentials-Popup-Four](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Show-Credentials-Popup-Four.png)

Once the user clicks the _OK_ button, the _Cancel_ button, or the _Close_ button, a text file will appear in your current working directory, and then, in the terminal/command prompt, an object will appear. The data may varie, depending on how the user reacted.

```
{ username: 'popup-prompt\\popup', password: 'password', error: null }
```

Now, let's go over what happens.

The first parameter is the title to display on the top of the popup.

The second parameter is the message to display to the user, telling them what the credential prompt is for.

The third parameter is the default username to show in the username field.

The fourth parameter is the name that will show behind the username. This shows the target of the user.

And that's how easy it is to display a credential popup to your user!

### Class: `Popup`

```
Popup()
```

This class creates a new `Popup` instance, which is a fully customizable popup.

**Important Note: `Popup` is still in _BETA_. If there is a bug (or you would like a new feature), please make a [new Issue](https://github.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/issues)!**

_Note: When you add components and run the popup, you will notice a PowerShell file appear in your current working directory. This is essential for the popup to display. Also, when the user enters text/clicks a button, then a text file may appear. This is essential for Powershell to communicate with NodeJS._

It is so easy to create a popup!

```js
const info = new popup.Popup();
```

_Note: In this example, we are creating a server reboot information dialog, so that is why the name is `info`._

Then, you can create the window for all the data. This will include the icon as well.

```js
info.createWindow("Server Reboot", [275, 175], true, "./favicon.ico");
```

_Note: The icon is a server-like image._

After that, we can add some components. In this example, we will only add a label and a button.

```js
info.componentLabel(
	"information",
	"The server rebooted at 2:14 PM on 16/10/2021.",
	[10, 20],
	[280, 20]
);
info.componentButton("button", "OK", [85, 75], [75, 25], "OK", true);
```

Then, finally, we can render the window, and display the popup.

```js
info.renderWindow(true);
info.openPopup((data, err) => {
	if (err) {
		console.log(err);
	} else {
		console.log(data);
	}
});
```

The total code is below.

```js
const info = new popup.Popup();

info.createWindow("Server Reboot", [275, 175], true, "./favicon.ico");

info.componentLabel(
	"information",
	"The server rebooted at 2:14 PM on 16/10/2021.",
	[10, 20],
	[280, 20]
);
info.componentButton("button", "OK", [85, 75], [75, 25], "OK", true);

info.renderWindow(true);
info.openPopup((data, err) => {
	if (err) {
		console.log(err);
	} else {
		console.log(data);
	}
});
```

This will open the popup below (depending on your OS).

![Popup-Popup-Three](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Popup-Popup-Three.png)

When the user clicks on the button, then, output to the terminal/command prompt is the button the user clicked on (in this case, _OK_).

```
OK
```

There is an even easier way to type the code, which gives us the same result. We can do this by _method chaining_.

```js
const info = new popup.Popup(); // We are not chaining from here, but you can if you want.

info.createWindow("Server Reboot", [275, 175], true, "./favicon.ico")
	.componentLabel(
		"information",
		"The server rebooted at 2:14 PM on 16/10/2021.",
		[10, 20],
		[280, 20]
	)
	.componentButton("button", "OK", [85, 75], [75, 25], "OK", true)
	.renderWindow(true)
	.openPopup((data, err) => {
		if (err) {
			console.log(err);
		} else {
			console.log(data);
		}
	});
```

This will give us the same result.

Now, let's see the methods in `Popup` in more detail.

#### `createWindow`

```
createWindow(title, size[, resizable][, iconPath][, startPos][, name])
```

This method creates a window, which is where all of the popup components go.

_Note: This method does not open the popup/window. To do this, run `openPopup`._

This method needs a title, which is the main title of the popup.

The next parameter is the size, which is an array of two numbers. These numbers determine the size of the window. So, `[300, 200]` means that the width is `300`, and the height is `200`.

After that come the optional parameters. The first optional parameter is for specifing if the window should be resizable.

The next parameter specifies the icon path for the icon on the popup window. This must be an `.ico` picture extension. If the icon is empty, then the default is a picture will red, blue, and yellow blocks.

The tipical sizes for an icon are _16 × 16_, _32 × 32_, and _48 × 48_ pixels. For great icons, see [this website](https://icon-icons.com/)!

After that is the start position. This is the position of the window. This defaults to `CenterScreen` and can be of the following values.

-   CenterParent
-   CenterScreen
-   Manual\*
-   WindowsDefaultBounds
-   WindowsDefaultLocation

_\* When `Manual` is set, there can be some issues._

Finally, the last parameter is the name of the window. **It is not recommended to change this value**, since if you do change it, then you will have to pass it in almost every other method. Therefore, it is easier to leave it alone (the default value is `window`).

#### `componentLabel`

```
componentLabel(name, text, location, size[, windowName])
```

This method creates a component label in the popup.

_Note: This method does not open the popup/window. To do this, run `openPopup`._

First, this method requires a name, which is like a variable for the label. **If you pass in a value that already exists, there can be errors.**

The next parameter is the text, which is basically the text to display on the label.

The third parameter is the location. This is an array of two numbers. These numbers determine the location from the top-left corner of the popup text, from the top-left of the popup window. For example, if the numbers are `[10, 20]`, then `10` is the width, and `20` is the height.

The fourth parameter is the size. This is an array of two numbers. These numbers determine the size of the text. For example, if the numbers are `[300, 20]`, then `300` is the width, and `20` is the height.

The final parameter is the name of the window. **It is not recommended to change this value**, since if you do change it, then you will have to pass it in almost every other method. Therefore, it is easier to leave it alone (the default value is `window`).

#### `componentButton`

```
componentButton(name, text, location, size, result[, listen][, windowName])
```

Create a component button in the popup.

_Note: This method does not open the popup/window. To do this, run `openPopup`._

This parameter requires a name as the first parameter, which is the variable for the button. **Beware that if you pass a value that exists, there could be errors.**

The next parameter is the text to display on the button.

The third parameter is the location. This is an array of two numbers. These numbers determine the location from the top-left corner of the popup text, from the top-left of the popup window. For example, if the numbers are `[10, 20]`, then `10` is the width, and `20` is the height.

The fourth parameter is the size. This is an array of two numbers. These numbers determine the size of the button. For example, if the numbers are `[75, 20]`, then `300` is the width, and `20` is the height.

The fifth parameter is the result, which is the result of the button (if `listen` is true). This is what is returned if `listen` is true.

The sixth optional parameter is a listener. This will wait for a click event, and when it occurs, it will return the `result` value.

The last parameter is the name of the window. **It is not recommended to change this value**, since if you do change it, then you will have to pass it in almost every other method. Therefore, it is easier to leave it alone (the default value is `window`).

#### `componentTextBox`

```
componentTextBox(name, location, size[, listen][, windowName])
```

Create a text box field in which the user can enter text in.

_Note: This method does not open the popup/window. To do this, run `openPopup`._

For the first parameter, like any other component, the text box requires a name, which is its variable name. **Beware that if you pass a value that exists, there could be errors.**

The second parameter is the location. This is an array of two numbers. These numbers determine the location from the top-left corner of the popup text, from the top-left of the popup window. For example, if the numbers are `[10, 20]`, then `10` is the width, and `20` is the height.

The third parameter is the size. This is an array of two numbers. These numbers determine the size of the text box. For example, if the numbers are `[250, 20]`, then `250` is the width, and `20` is the height.

After that come the optional parameters. The fourth one is a listener. This will wait for a _KeyUp_ event, and when it occurs, it will return the text. _Note: This method does not return the text after each KeyUp event. Also, beware that there could be **null** readings at times._

The last parameter is the name of the window. **It is not recommended to change this value**, since if you do change it, then you will have to pass it in almost every other method. Therefore, it is easier to leave it alone (the default value is `window`).

#### `componentImage`

```
componentImage(name, path, location[, windowName])
```

Create an image to display.

_Note: This method does not open the popup/window. To do this, run `openPopup`._

For the first parameter, like any other component, the image requires a name, which is its variable name. **Beware that if you pass a value that exists, there could be errors.**

The second parameter is the relative path of the image to display. This supports raster picture file types, so you can use file extensions such as `.png` and `.jpg`.

The third parameter is the location. This is an array of two numbers. These numbers determine the location from the top-left corner of the popup text, from the top-left of the popup window. For example, if the numbers are `[10, 10]`, then `10` is the width, and `10` is the height.

The last parameter is the name of the window. **It is not recommended to change this value**, since if you do change it, then you will have to pass it in almost every other method. Therefore, it is easier to leave it alone (the default value is `window`).

#### `componentListBox`

```
componentListBox(name, items, location, size, height[, listen][, windowName])
```

Create a list box, which is a list of items for the user to select from.

_Note: This method does not open the popup/window. To do this, run `openPopup`._

The first parameter is the name, which is the list's variable name. **Beware that if you pass a value that exists, there could be errors.**

The second parameter is the array of strings, which are the items to display.

The third parameter is the location. This is an array of two numbers. These numbers determine the location from the top-left corner of the popup text, from the top-left of the popup window. For example, if the numbers are `[10, 10]`, then `10` is the width, and `10` is the height.

The fourth parameter is the size. This is an array of two numbers. These numbers determine the size of the list box.

The fifth parameter is the height. This is the displayed height.

The sixth parameter specifies if the end result should be the selected value. Default value is `false`.

The seventh parameter is the name of the window. **It is not recommended to change this value**, since if you do change it, then you will have to pass it in almost every other method. Therefore, it is easier to leave it alone (the default value is `window`).

#### `renderWindow`

```
renderWindow([topmost][, name])
```

This method creates the code for the window to be properly rendered.

_Note: This method does not open the popup/window. To do this, run `openPopup`._

All of the parameters of this method are optional. Therefore, it is okay to not pass in anything.

The first parameter is if the window should be the topmost. This means that even if the window is out of focus, the popup will still stay on the top (unless the user clicks the minimize button).

The second and last parameter is the name of the window. **It is not recommended to change this value**, since if you do change it, then you will have to pass it in almost every other method. Therefore, it is easier to leave it alone (the default value is `window`).

#### `openPopup`

```
openPopup(callback)
```

This method opens the popup on the users computer.

There is only one required parameter, and that is the callback. It is usually called as below.

```js
popup.openPopup((data, err) => {
	if (err) {
		console.log(err);
	} else {
		// Do whatever you want with the data returned.
		console.log(data);
	}
});
```

Now, let's look at it in detail.

The first parameter that the callback passes is the data. This is the data from a button or text box (if `listen` is set to true). If there are no listeners, then the data will be a zero-length string. Otherwise, it will be the button clicked, or the text in the text box entered, depending on what has been listened.

The second parameter that the callback passes is the error. This is a string telling the user that an error occured.

_In v1.1.0, descriptive errors were introduced._

Once both of the parameters are there, then, in the callback body, you should add an `if/else` statement, and check if there is an error. The reason is because if there is an error, it will have a value, otherwise, it will have a value of `null`. The same applies for the `data`. In the `else` clause, you can do whatever you wish with the data.

## Real Examples

You may be wondering what `popup-prompt` can be used for in real life. Well, for testing purposes, we have created a few real-life examples for you to try!

### File Setup Wizard

This is a simple program which uses all of the methods issued in _v1.1.0_. It also uses `showMessageBox` with the `Popup` class!

See the code below, and then see the result!

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const files = new popup.Popup();

files
	.createWindow("File Setup Wizard", [500, 255], false, "./favicon.ico")
	.componentImage("pic", "./File-Setup.png", [0, 0])
	.componentLabel("title", "Welcome to the File Setup Wizard!", [125, 25], [200, 20])
	.componentLabel(
		"info",
		"To make a new file, type in the file contents, and we will make it!",
		[125, 75],
		[325, 20]
	)
	.componentTextBox("content", [125, 100], [325, 20], true)
	.componentButton("submit", "Create", [125, 150], [75, 25], "OK")
	.renderWindow(true)
	.openPopup((data, err) => {
		if (err) {
			console.log(err);

			popup.showMessageBox(
				`File Setup Wizard - Error Creating File`,
				`An error occured while creating the file. ERR_PROGRAM_ERROR`,
				"OK",
				"Error"
			);
		} else if (data) {
			try {
				fs.writeFileSync("text.txt", data);
			} catch (err) {
				console.log(err);

				popup.showMessageBox(
					`File Setup Wizard - Error Creating File`,
					`An error occured while creating the file. ERR_CREATION_ERROR`,
					"OK",
					"Error"
				);
			}

			popup.showMessageBox(
				`File Setup Wizard - Created File`,
				`Successfully created the file! See it in your present working directory (PWD).`,
				"OK",
				"Information"
			);
		} else {
			popup.showMessageBox(
				`File Setup Wizard - Error Creating File`,
				`An error occured while creating the file. ERR_NO_CONTENT`,
				"OK",
				"Error"
			);
		}
	});
```

Now, after a bunch of code, let's see the result!

![Popup-Real-One](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Popup-Real-One.png)

If we pass in file contents, we should see a success message, and a new file in the PWD (present working directory).

![Popup-Real-Two](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Popup-Real-Two.png)

If we don't pass in any file contents (or another error occured), we should see an error message.

![Popup-Real-Three](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Popup-Real-Three.png)

So, even though it's a bit of code, the end result is _amazing_!

### Letter Counter

This quick demo shows how a text box is used to get input from a user, count the number of letters, and display another box with the results.

```js
new popup.Popup()
	.createWindow("Letter Counter", [500, 220], false, "./favicon.ico")
	.componentImage("pic", "./Letters.png", [10, 10])
	.componentLabel("title", "Letter Occurance Counter", [175, 25], [200, 20])
	.componentLabel(
		"info",
		"This counter will automatically count the number of letters in the sentence you pass!",
		[175, 60],
		[300, 30]
	)
	.componentTextBox("content", [175, 100], [300, 20], true)
	.componentButton("submit", "Count!", [175, 135], [75, 25], "OK")
	.renderWindow(true)
	.openPopup((data, err) => {
		if (err) {
			console.log(err);
		} else {
			const letters = [...data];
			const occurances = {};

			letters.forEach((letter) => {
				letter = letter
					.replace(/[!"#$%&'()*+,-.\\/:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~]/g, "")
					.trim()
					.toLowerCase();

				occurances[letter] ? (occurances[letter] += 1) : (occurances[letter] = 1);
			});

			Object.keys(occurances).forEach((key) => {
				if (key === "") {
					delete occurances[key];
				}
			});

			let formatted = "";
			for (const key in occurances) {
				formatted += `${key}  -  ${occurances[key]}\n`;
			}

			new popup.Popup()
				.createWindow("Letter Counter Results", [500, 220], true, "./favicon.ico")
				.componentImage("pic", "./Letters.png", [10, 10])
				.componentLabel("title", "Letter Occurance Counter Results", [175, 25], [200, 20])
				.componentLabel(
					"info",
					"See the stats below for the number of occurances!",
					[175, 60],
					[300, 30]
				)
				.componentLabel("stats", formatted, [200, 100], [300, 100])
				.renderWindow(true)
				.openPopup((data, err) => {
					if (err) {
						console.log(err);
					}
				});
		}
	});
```

That's a lot of code! But, it still works...

![Popup-Real-Four](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Popup-Real-Four.png)

If we pass in _Popup Prompt_, it will show the number of characters (excluding symbols and spaces) below.

![Popup-Real-Five](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Popup-Real-Five.png)

And that's how simple it is to make a should-be-complex-program with `popup-prompt`!

## More Coming Soon!

Even though we are thinking hard for ideas, we would _love_ it if you would make a [new Issue](https://github.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/issues) for a feature request!

## Bugs?

We know that no one likes bugs in their code, so if you find a bug, please make a [new Issue](https://github.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/issues), and describe the bug.

## On Another Platform (other than Windows)?

If you are on another OS (other than Windows), it would be highly appreciated if you could send screenshots of how your popups/prompts look like. Also, if there are any bugs on other operating systems, then maybe you can help as a contributer!

/**
 * This method shows a customizable message box. It can have a title, message, button/buttons and an image.
 *
 * _Note: When you run this method, you will notice a PowerShell file appear in your current working directory. This is essential for the popup to display. Also, when a user clicks on a button, a text file will appear with the button clicked. This is for the PowerShell file to communicate with NodeJS._
 *
 * This method returns a `Promise`, which contains the button on which the user clicked on.
 *
 * Example of usage:
 *
 * ```js
 * popup
 * 	.showMessageBox(
 * 		"Confirm Deleting File",
 * 		"Are you sure you want to delete the file? This action is irreversible.",
 * 		"YesNoCancel",
 * 		"Warning",
 * 		"No"
 * 	)
 * 	.then((btn) => {
 * 		console.log(btn);
 * 	})
 * 	.catch((err) => {
 * 		console.log(err);
 * 	});
 * ```
 *
 * So, when you run this code, you should see a PowerShell file appear in your working directory. Soon after that, a message should appear, similar to this one.
 *
 * _Note: Depending on your OS platform and version, your popup may look slightly different. However, the functionality should be the same. Also, the window icon is the PowerShell logo._
 *
 * ![Show-Message-Box-Popup-One](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Show-Message-Box-Popup-One.png)
 *
 * Then, logged to the console will be whatever the user chose (in this case, the choosen one is _No_).
 *
 * ```
 * No
 * ```
 *
 * @param title The title is a string of the name of the popup/window. This appears when the user sees the top of the popup, and also when they see the taskbar (Windows) and see the name.
 * @param message The description, where you can write a sentence or two, telling the user what the popup is for.
 * @param type The buttons that display on the bottom. They, however, can only be a few values. Passing anything other than this will cause an error.
 * @param picture The icon to display. This is a set list of icons, and must only be of a few values.
 * @param defaultOption The default value for the button. So, if the user clicks _Enter_ when the popup comes, and the default value is set, then it will automatically go with it. It must be one of the button values.
 * @returns This method returns a `Promise`, which contains the button on which the user clicked on.

/**
 * The method creates a customizable prompt popup. This includes the title, the message, and the default value for the text field.
 * 
 * _Note: When you run this method, you will notice a PowerShell file appear in your current working directory. This is essential for the prompt to display. Also, when the user enters their text, a text file will appear with the text entered. This is for the PowerShell file to communicate with NodeJS._
 * 
 * This method returns a `Promise`, which contains the string that the user entered. _Note: If the user presses the Cancel button, or presses the **X** (close) button, then the returned value will be a zero-length string._
 * 
 * Below is an example of how to use the method.

 * ```js
 * popup
 * 	.showPrompt("New File", "Type the new file name below.", "text.txt")
 * 	.then((fileName) => {
 * 		console.log(fileName);
 * 	})
 * 	.catch((err) => {
 * 		console.log(err);
 * 	});
 * ```
 * 
 * When you run the code, like `showMessageBox`, a PowerShell file will appear in your current working directory, and then, a prompt message similar to this one (depending on your OS, the prompt may look different) will show up.
 * 
 * ![Show-Prompt-Popup-Two](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Show-Prompt-Popup-Two.png)
 * 
 * Once the user clicks _Enter_, the _OK_ button, the _Cancel_ button, or the _Close_ button, a text file will appear in your current working directory, and then, in the terminal/command prompt, the text that the user entered will show up. In this example, we will pretend that the user entered _text.txt_.
 * 
 * ```
 * text.txt
 * ```
 * 
 * Then, you can do whatever you want with the value!
 * 
 * @param title The title. This is a string that should appear at the top on the popup window, and also on the taskbar (Windows) when they hover over the window.
 * @param message The message. This can be a sentence or two, telling the user what the prompt is for.
 * @param defaultValue The default value. This is the value that should appear by default in the text field. This will be highlighted (like in the picture), so that if the user wants to go with it, they can just press _Enter_.
 * @returns A `Promise`, which contains the string that the user entered. _Note: If the user presses the Cancel button, or presses the **X** (close) button, then the returned value will be a zero-length string._

/**
 * Show a credential prompt to the user. On Windows, this includes a picture of keys as the header, along with the username and password input.
 *
 * This method returns an object, with the username, password, and error. If an error occured, then username and password are `null`, otherwise, if everything went okay, error is `null`.
 *
 * Please note that the password is stored in plain text. It is your responsibility to make the string secure.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```js
 * popup
 *	    .showCredentials(
 *	   	    "Popup Prompt Login",
 *	   	    "Please enter your credentials to login to Popup Prompt.",
 *	   	    "",

 *	    })
 *	    .catch((err) => {
 *	   	    console.log(err);
 *	    });
 * ```
 *
 * If the user does not cancel the authentication, then the returned value should be an object. The popup will look as below (on Windows 10).
 *
 * ![Show-Credentials-Popup-Four](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnavthorat78/Popup-Prompt/main/img/Show-Credentials-Popup-Four.png)
 *
 * That's all!

 * @param title The title to display on the top of the popup.
 * @param message The message to display to the user, telling them what the credential prompt is for.
 * @param username The default username to show in the username field.
 * @param targetName The name that will show behind the username. This shows the target of the user.

If there are no listeners, then the data will be a zero-length string. Otherwise, it will be the button clicked, or the text in the text box entered, depending on what has been listened.
	 *
	 * The second parameter that the callback passes is the error. This is a string telling the user that an error occured. _Note: This method does not exactly tell what the error is. This may be introduced in version 1.1.0._
	 *
	 * Once both of the parameters are there, then, in the callback body, you should add an `if/else` statement, and check if there is an error. The reason is because if there is an error, it will have a value, otherwise, it will have a value of `null`. The same applies for the `data`. In the `else` clause, you can do whatever you wish with the data.
	 *
	 * @param callback The callback to invoke when the callback has finished (or started, if there is an error).
